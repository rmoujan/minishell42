# Minishell

This project is about creating a simple shell.
Working together with my teammate, we took on the challenge of building a simple shell from scratch. We split the project into two main jobs. First, we tackled parsing, where we broke down the command line into different parts like words, redirections, and arguments. Then, in the second part, we focused on execution. We used the parsed information to make the shell carry out the commands. This approach helped us learn a lot about how operating system processes and file descriptors work, and it gave us hands-on experience with command-line interfaces.
